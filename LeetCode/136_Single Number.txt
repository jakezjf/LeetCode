Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?


解法：
XOR 用异或的方法可以判断

4^8^3^5^4^1^8^5^6^6^3  = ((4^4)^(8^8)^(3^3)^(5^5)^(6^6)^3)  0^0^0^0^0^3
